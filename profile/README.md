## ZEN of Sap


- `Self-consistency` is better than `contradiction`
- `intuition` is better than `thinking`
- `monotonous` is better than `complexity`
- `structure` is better than `process`
- `logic` is better than `randomness`
- `transparency` is better than `fuzziness`
- `hierarchy` is better than `flatness`
- `distribution` is better than `centralization`
